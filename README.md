# Nature Denatured and Found Again - Web Experience

This is an **unofficial fan project** inspired by Michael Pisaro's "Nature Denatured and Found Again" (2019), a 5-CD set released by Gravity Wave. The original work is designed to be experienced by playing all 5 CDs simultaneously in different rooms, creating an evolving soundscape that changes as listeners move between spaces.

This web application attempts to recreate that spatial listening experience in a virtual environment. **This is not meant to be a faithful replication of the original work**, but rather an interactive homage that explores similar concepts of space, sound, and movement.

## Important Note

This project **does not distribute any copyrighted material**. To experience this web application, users must provide their own audio files. I strongly encourage supporting the original artists by purchasing the album through official channels:

- [Bandcamp](https://michaelpisaro.bandcamp.com/album/nature-denatured-and-found-again)
- [Erstwhile Records](https://www.erstwhilerecords.com/store/p265/Michael_Pisaro_-_Nature_Denatured_and_Found_Again_%285CD%29.html)

## Attribution

The original work "Nature Denatured and Found Again" was created by Michael Pisaro-Liu and released on Gravity Wave, a label he founded with Jon Abbey (erstwhile records) and Yuko Zama (elsewhere music).

## Usage

1. Purchase and obtain the original album
2. Load your audio files into the application
3. Start the experience
4. Use arrow keys or WASD to move through the virtual space
5. Experience how the soundscape changes based on your position relative to the virtual sound sources
